## Usage

At the point of publishing this visualization, Steam's own API does not show details such as game ownership and playtime. Since Steam added account privacy features in 2018 rendering scraping impracticable, pulling data from Steam Spy's API for such information is the only option but it is approximated data based on Steam Spy's algorithm (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Spy).
